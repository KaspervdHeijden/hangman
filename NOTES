- When installing dependencies with composer, I could not install "doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle": "2.1.*@dev".
  I had to change it to "doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle": "1.1.1" to get it to work.

- Preferably, I would install a bundle (friendsofsymfony/rest-bundle) to optimize the REST server.
  Sadly, the bundle is not compatible with this symfony project version (It requires 2.7).

- Initially, I presumed PHP 7.1. The varous type hints were commented out to support PHP 5.3.
